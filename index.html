          <h5>CEO-eDisign</h5>
           <p>My father permitted me to use computer from my early childhood. I learned English alphabets by typing it in notepad. I used to draw pictures in MS Paint even before joining LKG. So computer is my intimate friend. When I was six years old, my father showed me a website designed by a young boy and told me that if I am interested I can also do it. Then I tried it by using MS Word and then in MS Front Page. I designed my first website, the one for my school www.presentationhss.com while I was 8 years old. Now I am using....</p>

           <p>I was born in Mumbai, I can’t remember when (laughs). I grew up in Tata House, which is now the head office of Deutsche Bank; it was the house that my grandfather built but never lived to see it completed. My grandmother lived there and my father lived with her; so I grew up in that house. I went to school in Mumbai; most of my schooling was in Campion School, but the last three years were at Cathedral School because Campion ran out of classes. I joined Campion when it had started and each year it added a class; finally they didn’t....</p>           <button class=" slide-btn btn-lg">Read More</button>

          <p>Well at Reliance what we always thought, and this really is from my father, is business always has to have a purpose. So we will focus on our existing sectors. We will think about what societal gaps, particularly (those which) exist in India that need either our expertise in management or financial resources. These gaps need to be filled or corrected and sometimes it is about creating a new business model. The third leg we are adding to is organic as well as inorganic growth I think that if I can take a much longer-term view then ....</p>
